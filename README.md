Minecraft-Init
==============

This script was initally created for my server networks.  As this is nothing special I've decided to release this and update it to the latest version of Minecraft.

Installiation is easy.  Just add this to your /etc/init.d folder and add it as a init.

Development has been cancelled as this project; all new development is a closed project.
